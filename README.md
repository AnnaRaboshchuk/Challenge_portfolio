## "Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?"
I decided to participate in this Dare IT project because I interested in tech brances, such as testing and coding (Front-End). I started learn the theory of testing a few months ago. But theory is not a practice. I still don't know how testing is working, how to create test cases in fact, what is automaticaly testing is? Now I also go throught the course for Front-End. So I surf through the Internet and saw the advertise of this Challenge. And now here I am! I want to better understand what I deal with in my learning. And I want to find a good satisfying job in Tech. Thank you for the chance to improve my knowledge and understanding.
